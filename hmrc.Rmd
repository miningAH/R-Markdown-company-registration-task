# Task Brief

You are required to present an analysis of Company Registration data, along with turnover and business type.  

The data is based upon Open Source information. It has been anonymised and manipulated for the purposes of this exercise. Fictional turnover and Trade Type data has been added. The dataset is not representative of any real life Company and no attempt should be made to identify real businesses through it.  

All the necessary data is contained in the Excel Workbook, and you can use any software you wish to analyse it. However, it is expected that most people will use Excel, or an equivalent program like Google Sheets, or Open Office Calc. 

We would like the presentation to cover your answers to the questions below, and the methods used to reach your conclusions. 

1. Which sectors show the greatest increase and decrease in turnover over the years available? 

2. What is the total turnover for "Farming" broken down by year? 

3. What is the LEAST common month to incorporate a business? Is this true for all Company Types? 

4. What other conclusions can be drawn from the data. We are particularly interested in trends over time, and comparisons between different geographic areas. 


\newpage

# Chapter 1 - Introduction

## 1.1. Data Source

See 'The Task' section of this report.

## 1.2. Technologies

Excel has been used to conduct feature engineering to gain useful geographical features from the postal code. 
R has been for all remaining data analysis activities including data pre-processing, visualisations, and analysis.
The R-Studio IDE has been used as the environment for analysis efforts.

## 1.3. Methodology and report structure

The analysis methodology used for this task is based on the first four of the six stages of the CRISP-DM framework followed by a delivery / sharing stage. The five stages, which also give this report its structure, are as follows:

1) Business understanding - Exploring all unknown contextual concepts and issues.
2) Data understanding - Exploring the raw data for an initial understanding.
3) Data preparation - Cleansing the data from issues such as duplicates, incorrect values and so on.
4) Data Analysis - Analysing the data for insights and the questions mentioned in the task brief.
5) Insights sharing - Creating a presentation to share data insights discovered.

## 1.4. Assumptions

Due to the nature of this task, clarifying the dataset origins and testing its adequacy is not possible.
Therefore to be able to make conclusions and draw insights from the data it is assumed that either:

- the dataset constitutes an entire population of records or a representative sample of one, or 
- that the conclusions being incorrect to the real world is not an issue, as the dataset is to be dealt with in isolation. 

\newpage

# Chapter 2 - Business / Contextual Understanding

The following chapter describes the contextual research conducted to support the analysis phase of the task.

## Company Registration

A registered company is one that has been incorporated at Companies House (the UK's national business registry).

An organisation would undergo this registration in order to become a limited company.[@website_govuk_companieshouse_blog]


"A limited company is a type of business structure that is incorporated (registered) at Companies House. It is a distinct legal entity that is completely separate from its owners (members), which means that itâ€™s responsible for its own finances and debts.
Companies are managed by one or more directors. They are appointed by members to run the business on their behalf, but it is common for directors to also be members.
The owners of a limited company benefit from reduced financial responsibility for business debts. This is known as limited liability." (@website_first_formations)

Company Registration data will therefore contain information about companies that have registered at Companies House. These are limited liability companies and therefore excludes sole traderships.

Note that "Once incorporation at Companies House has been accepted the Corporation Tax information will be sent to HMRC and will not be retained by Companies House." [@website_companieshouse]

Finally, a lot of data is provided to Companies House on a yearly basis, including financial statements. (@website_companieshouse_accounts).

## UK postal codes

UK postal codes were developed by the UK's postal service, Royal Mail, in order to be able to deliver posts.
The Royal Mail maintains a UK-wide system of postcodes. 

Postcodes are alphanumeric references that help to identify geographical areas. They comprise of two parts, an outward code of between 2 to 4 characters and an inward code of three characters. The outward code references the postcode area and district of a particular geographical location. The inward code provides finer location identification. (@website_ons_postal)

It is important to note that UK postal codes always start with a letter and that a full postcode (Unit postcode) will always be between 5 and 7 charcters long. [@website_ideal_postcodes].

# Chapter 3 - Data Understanding

The following chapter discusses an initial exploration of the dataset provided for the task at hand. The goal behind this stage was to gain a general understanding of the data by manually exploring the data, and to spot any quality issues which would need to be addressed in the subsequent stage of data preparation.

## 3.1. Viewing the first and last five records of the dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Viewing the first 5 rows of the data
first_five_rows <- head(hmrcdata, 5)

# Converting the first 5 rows into a flextable for better visual style in the report
flextable(first_five_rows) %>%
  set_caption("First 5 Rows of HMRC Data") %>%
  autofit()  # Adjusting column widths to fit the content

```

The first five records of the HMRC dataset indicates fairly regular and clean data however with many missing values. Some attributes represent categorical features and would therefore need to be assessed for any category related errors. For instance, when the same word, one with a capitalised starting letter and the lower cased, constitute two separate categories when they should be one. The issue of missing data needs to be investigated and the values of records, for each attribute, checked for correctness. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Viewing the first 5 rows of the data
last_five_rows <- head(hmrcdata, 5)

# Converting the last 5 rows into a flextable for better visual style in the report
flextable(last_five_rows) %>%
  set_caption("Last 5 Rows of HMRC Data") %>%
  autofit()  # Adjusting column widths to fit the content
```

The last five records of the HMRC dataset confirms that there are records in the dataset that are not appropriate for analysis.This is because these records represent summary records.

## 3.2. Viewing a glimpse of the dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}

glimpse(hmrcdata) # Viewing a glimpse of the dataset (some values for each attribute, there types, and total row and column amounts)

```

Viewing a quick glimpse of the dataset reveals that the data has 18 attributes and a little over 50 thousand records. It is important for analysis reasons to note that the turnover for the years 2020 to 2024 are provided within columns. This should mean that in general only a single record should exist for each company name.

\newpage

## 3.3. Manually exploring the dataset

Manually exploring the entire dataset through changing column sorting and filtering revealed the following:

- Incorrect postcode values exist, for instance they might contain only numbers, be too short, or not start with a letter.
- Outliers and extreme values are not an issue within the dataset.

# Chapter 4 - Data Preperation

The following chapter outlines the data preparation activities undertaken to ensure that the data is of sufficient enough quality to move ahead with analysis efforts. 

## 4.1. Feature Engineering - new attributes

To begin with, in order to undertake geographic analysis the postcode attribute from the original dataset was used to generate the following four features: Country, Region, Longitude, and Latitude.The changes were made in Excel and involved calling the postcodes.io api (@website_postcodes_api) with each postcode and then extracting the relevant attribute values from the json formatted response.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# an example of the function used in excel to get json api response is as follows:
  # (=WEBSERVICE("https://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/" & C2)) 
```

## 4.2. Fixing incorrect Data Types

The data types of several attributes in the dataset were initially incorrect. To fix these issue the Incorporation Date and Company Closed Date where changed to a date type, whilst Longitude, and Latitude were both made into doubles (decimal number type).

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
str(hmrcdata) # str is a diagnostic function - it displays the internal structure of an R object. shows a summary of the data similar to the glimpse function.
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# changing attributes of type POSIXct to date
hmrcdata$IncorporationDate <- as_date(hmrcdata$IncorporationDate) 
hmrcdata$`Company Closed Date` <- as_date(hmrcdata$`Company Closed Date`)
hmrcdata$`Accounts Last Made Date` <- as_date(hmrcdata$`Accounts Last Made Date`)

# changing attributes of type character to double
hmrcdata$Latitude <- as.double(hmrcdata$Latitude)
hmrcdata$Longitude <- as.double(hmrcdata$Longitude)

# changing attributes of type character to factor
hmrcdata$Region <- as.factor(hmrcdata$Region)
hmrcdata$Country <- as.factor(hmrcdata$Country)
hmrcdata$CountryOfOrigin <- as.factor(hmrcdata$CountryOfOrigin)
hmrcdata$CompanyCategory <- as.factor(hmrcdata$CompanyCategory)
hmrcdata$`Company Reference` <- as.factor(hmrcdata$`Company Reference`)
hmrcdata$`Company Type` <- as.factor(hmrcdata$`Company Type`)
```

## 4.3. Checking for total duplicates

To ensure statistical figures would be accurate the existence of duplicates was investigated. A total of 35 rows were found to be total duplicates (same values across all attributes). This issue was resolved by filtering the dataset to ensure that only distinct values remained.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#checking for duplicate rows using dplyr
hmrcdata %>%
  group_by_all() %>%
  filter(n()>1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Keeping a single record from records that are total duplicates using dplyr
hmrcdata <- hmrcdata %>%
  distinct()  # Retains only the first occurrence of each duplicate row
```

## 4.4. Checking businesses that have multiple records

Similar to duplicate checking, the issue of businesses having multiple records associated to themselves was explored. This is because the existence of multiple records could be problematic if they contain contradicting information, or one is new whilst the other outdated. The results showed that only a single business had two records and that these records were not problematic and so were left in the dataset.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# getting all rows in which the company name value occurs more than once (this value show in more than one row)
duplicates <- hmrcdata %>%
  group_by(`Company Name`) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

# Viewing these duplicates
 print(duplicates)
```

## 4.5. Checking for missing data for each column 

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# checking the number of missing data for each column
sapply(hmrcdata, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

Many columns contain missing values. for some of these attributes the precense of missing values is expected, for instance 49,132 records have the company closed date as empty because they are still active and not closed. However for many others no logical reason can be determined as to why they would be missing. In such a case of large amounts of missing values, imputing values or removing records is not useful, hence the dataset will be used with these limitations in mind.

## 4.6. Checking for incorrect record values 

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Getting the distinct and sorted values for all columns
distinct_sorted_values <- lapply(hmrcdata, function(column) {
  unique_values <- sort(unique(column))
  return(unique_values)
})

# Assigning column names to the results for clarity
names(distinct_sorted_values) <- colnames(hmrcdata)

# Printing the results
print(distinct_sorted_values)
```

Checking attributes for appropriate values revealed the following points:

- Attributes with fewer distinct values such as Company Type, Company Category, Company Reference, and Country of origin are free from value related issues. 
- Region, Country, longitude and latitude, due to being computed values engineered in excel, also do not have data value issues.
- The Turnover columns (2020 to 2024) also show to be free from value errors, determined through manually sorting.
- The remaining 5 attributes require deeper checks to ensure values are correct. Due to having too many distinct values a formatting based check will be required to ensure data values are as expected. Sections 4.6.1 to 4.6.3 will discuss these checks further.

### 4.6.1. Checking date values

A check to ensure that that the Incorporated Date, Accounts Last Made Date, and Company Closed Date adhered to the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format was used to ensure that all date values were correct.

```{r echo =FALSE, include=FALSE}

# checking incorporated date for value related issues

# defining a Regular expression with the YYYY-MM-DD format
valid_date_format <- "^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$"

# Checking for invalid dates using the regular expression defined above and the grepl function. Ignoring NA values
invalid_dates <- hmrcdata[!is.na(hmrcdata$IncorporationDate) & 
                          !grepl(valid_date_format, hmrcdata$IncorporationDate), ]

# Printing the records with invalid dates. if none - printing "all dates are valid"
if (nrow(invalid_dates) > 0) {
  print("Records with invalid date format:")
  print(invalid_dates)
} else {
  print("All dates are valid.")
}

```


```{r echo =FALSE, include=FALSE}

# checking accounts last made date for value related issues

# Checking for invalid dates using the regular expression defined previously and the grepl function. Ignoring NA values
invalid_dates <- hmrcdata[!is.na(hmrcdata$`Accounts Last Made Date`) & 
                          !grepl(valid_date_format, hmrcdata$`Accounts Last Made Date`), ]

# Printing the records with invalid dates. if none - printing "all dates are valid"
# the same if-else block is repeated earlier. could be ref-factored.
if (nrow(invalid_dates) > 0) {
  print("Records with invalid date format:")
  print(invalid_dates)
} else {
  print("All dates are valid.")
}

```

```{r echo =FALSE, include=FALSE}

# checking company closed date for value related issues

# Checking for invalid dates using the regular expression defined previously and the grepl function. Ignoring NA values
invalid_dates <- hmrcdata[!is.na(hmrcdata$`Company Closed Date`) & 
                          !grepl(valid_date_format, hmrcdata$`Company Closed Date`), ]

# Printing the records with invalid dates. if none - printing "all dates are valid"
# the same if-else block is repeated earlier. could be ref-factored.
if (nrow(invalid_dates) > 0) {
  print("Records with invalid date format:")
  print(invalid_dates)
} else {
  print("All dates are valid.")
}

```

Ignoring missing values all records (for each of the attributes) adhered to the specified date format. Therefore, no value related issues exist for these attributes.

### 4.6.2. Checking Company Name values 

To fix the company name value issues found during data understanding stage, company names beginning with the word 'summary' were removed from the dataset as they represented summary records and would therefore effect analysis values if left in. 

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# filtering out companies that start with 'Summary' using dplyr/grepl
hmrcdata <- hmrcdata %>%
  filter(!grepl("^Summary", `Company Name`))

print(hmrcdata)
```

After removing these records, the remaining records were of the same format ('Business-' followed by a string of numbers), and thus do not have any remaining issues.

### 4.6.3. Checking postcode values 

To fix the postcode value related issues found during data understanding stage a format check was used to find all records that start with other than a letter, only has alphanumeric values, and has a length of 4 to 7. After checking over the 40 records returned, the postcode values for each were removed due to being incorrect and would have a negative impact on analysis efforts.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# A Regular expression to check that the postcode is in the correct format (starts with alphabet, only has alphanumeric values, has a length of 4 to 7)
valid_postcode_regex <- "^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9 ]{4,7}$"

# Checking for invalid postcodes using the regular expression defined previously and the grepl function. Ignoring NA values
invalid_postcodes <- hmrcdata[!is.na(hmrcdata$Postcode) & 
                              !grepl(valid_postcode_regex, hmrcdata$Postcode), ]

# Printing the records with invalid postcodes if none - printing "all dates are valid"
if (nrow(invalid_postcodes) > 0) {
  print("Records with invalid postcodes:")
  print(invalid_postcodes)
} else {
  print("All postcodes are valid or NA.")
}

# Replacing the records found to have invalid postcodes with NA for the postcode value.
hmrcdata$Postcode[!is.na(hmrcdata$Postcode) & 
                  !grepl(valid_postcode_regex, hmrcdata$Postcode)] <- NA
```

### 4.7. Creating a long formatted version of the dataset for analysis.

As earlier noted, the original dataset has turnover values in columns based on the year. 
This format is not the most efficient for conducting analysis efforts, and so a longer format is needed, one in which the turnover year is separate from the actual turn over. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Reshaping the data to a more normalised format for analysis. 
# why? the columns 2020 turnover etc should have come from a separate turnover table with a relationship to the companies table.
# when the dataset at hand was put together information that should have originally been on 2 separate tables seem to have been combined.
# the rows like 2020 turnover etc are an issue as they convey 2 pieces of information (the year and the turnover value) and therefore can be said to be not adequately normalised. decoupling these 2 pieces of information makes the dataset easier to analyse.
hmrcdata_long <- hmrcdata %>%
# using the pivot longer method from tidyr. 
    # cols: takes the columns to pivot, 
    # names_to: holds the names to be used as values in a new column. User specifies the column name for this new column, 
    # values_to: holds the values to be made into a new column. User specifies the column name for this new values column
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("20"), 
    names_to = "TurnoverYear",   
    values_to = "Turnover"         
  ) %>%
  mutate(TurnoverYear = as.numeric(gsub(" Turnover", "", TurnoverYear)))  # Cleaning up the TurnoverYear column by removing the characters "turnover" from values.

```

As a result of creating this new dataset the number of rows increased from just under 50,000 to just under 250,000. In addition, two new columns were made; one holding the year of turnover (TurnoverYear) and the other holding turnover values (Turnover). The original turnover columns such as '2020 Turnover' are no longer in the dataset.

\newpage

# Chapter 5 - Data Analysis

This chapter details the data analysis efforts conducted for the task at hand, beginning with a general Exploratory Data Analysis stage, followed by exploration of the task based questions.

## 5.1. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis - Statistical summary of the dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(hmrcdata_long)

summary(hmrcdata)
summary(hmrcdata[, c("2020 Turnover", "2021 Turnover", "2022 Turnover", "2023 Turnover", "2024 Turnover", "IncorporationDate")])
```

Viewing a statistical summary of the data we can learn that:

- The earliest incorporation date within the dataset is in February 1902 and the latest is November 2024.
- 23 records don't have an incorporation date which shouldn't missing considering the fact that the dataset is about company registration.
- The mean turnover is the highest in 2020. This falls to the lowest average turnover of 590,573 in 2021. Since then the turnover has been increasing year on year with the mean turnover falling at 765,641.
- The max turnover values for each year (2020 - 2024) are around 3.8 million showing that extreme outliers are not affecting the differences between mean values. The same concept of outliers and extreme values also apply to minimum turnover values.

## 5.2. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis - Visual investigation

### 5.2.1. Viewing the statuses of organisations in the dataset (open, closed, in liquidation)

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Grouping and summarising data by count
hmrcdata_filtered_Reg_Ref <- hmrcdata_long %>%
  group_by(Region, `Company Reference`) %>%
    summarize(Count = n(), .groups = "drop")

# creating a stacked Bar Chart with a log scale for an easier to read plot
ggplot(hmrcdata_filtered_Reg_Ref, aes(x = factor(Region), y = Count, fill = `Company Reference`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.7) +  # Creating the stacked bars
    scale_y_log10() +  # using the log scale for better visibility of small values
  geom_text(aes(label = Count), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +  # Adding count labels inside bars
  labs(
    title = "Organisational Statuses by Region",
    x = "Region",
    y = "Log Scale of Count",
    fill = "Status"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") + # changing the colour pallete for better visual contrast
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotating the x-axis labels for better readability
    legend.position = "top"  # Positioning the legend at the top
  ) 

```

Viewing a visual summary of the data we can learn that:

- Most of the dataset contains open businesses however in every region their are a number of organisations that are closed or in  liquidation. These findings are important to note when considering which records you want to keep when doing calculations / answering questions using the data.

\newpage

## 5.3. Exploring the task based questions

### 5.3.1. Question 1 - Which sectors show the greatest increase and decrease in turnover over the years available? 

#### Change in turnover over the years (difference between the latest and earliest year).

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Filtering the long formatted into a new data frame that only has 2020 and 2024 turnover data
filtered_data <- hmrcdata_long %>%
  filter(TurnoverYear %in% c(2020, 2024))  # Keeping only rows in which TurnoverYear is 2020 or 2024

# Calculating the differences between the turovers in 2024 and 2020 (2024 values - 2020 values)
comparison_data <- filtered_data %>%

    Turnover_2024 = sum(Turnover[TurnoverYear == 2024], na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  mutate(Difference = Turnover_2024 - Turnover_2020)

# Creating a bar plot to visual the difference
ggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = reorder(`Company Type`, Difference), y = Difference, fill = Difference > 0)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "lightgreen")) +  # Red colour set for negative values and green for positive
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  # Converting the Y-axis labels to a non-scientific format (via the scales package)
    geom_text(aes(label = scales::comma(Difference)),  # Adding the labels with commas to make them easier to read
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),    # Positioning count labels in the middle of each bar segment
            color = "black", size = 4) +  
  labs(
    title = "Change in Turnover from 2020 to 2024 by Company Type",
    x = "Company Type",
    y = "Difference in Turnover"
  ) +
